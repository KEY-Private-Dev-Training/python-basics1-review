### Problem 1:
Create a program that echos back to the user whatever they type in as input. Continue echoing the user input until they enter 'q' to quit.

### Problem 2:
Ask the user for their name. Then ask the user for a number of times they want their name printed. Print the name the number of times the user requested. If they enter a number 0 (zero) or less, display a message and ask them again for a positive number.

### Problem 3:
Create a program that collects user input.If they enter a number between 1 and 3,print the number entered. If they enter 0 or 'q', exit the program. If they enter anything else, print an error message. Keep prompting the user for input until they quit the program.

### Problem 4:
Create a program that takes the user input until they enter 'q'. You should store all of their input into a list. Once they enter 'q', print out all the entered words separated by a comma.

ex. ```kevin, kris, zach```
